      "content": "There are multiple ways for that. Content is still very important, and shareable content even more. Without budget, it's important to create value for the user. Users like to talk about your content and love to share it. You'll get backlinks pretty natural that way. Another way is using reddit, which is a topic of it's own. Building a fanbase of users is always important, but that's more marketing than SEO related (even though it's pretty much interconnected).\nif the budget they're paying goes directly to you, but they don't want to pay for backlinks directly, start working on building up a network for them (PR Work). It will help them in the long run, but you need to do this whitelabeled (best with an email adress of the client). But overall, with small clients, it's better to focus on the basics",
